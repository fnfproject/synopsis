Introduction 
	The project aims to create a user-friendly platform for trainers to build a centralized 	collection of multiple-choice questions (MCQs). This software will allow trainers to 	categorize questions by subject, topic, and difficulty level, making it easy to generate 	customized question papers. Trainees can access these papers through secure, time-	limited web links, answer the questions, and receive instant feedback on their 	performance. The application also supports bulk uploads of questions from specific 	file formats and enables trainers to export questions and answers for further use.
