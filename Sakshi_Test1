Certainly! To enhance the provided C# code snippet, we can create a simple HTML page that displays the hyperlink along with a countdown timer for the expiration of the link. Below is the complete code that includes the countdown timer and the message "Welcome to my generated hyperlink."

### Full Code Example

Hereâ€™s how you can implement this functionality:

#### Step 1: Update the C# Code

We'll modify the `GenerateQuestionPaper` method to include a countdown timer in the HTML output.

```csharp
using System;
using System.IO;

public class QuestionPaperGenerator
{
    public string GenerateQuestionPaper(string[] questions, TimeSpan validDuration)
    {
        // Create HTML content for the question paper with a countdown timer
        string expirationTime = DateTime.Now.Add(validDuration).ToString("yyyy-MM-ddTHH:mm:ss");
        string htmlContent = $@"
        <html>
        <head>
            <title>Question Paper</title>
            <style>
                body {{ font-family: Arial, sans-serif; }}
                #timer {{ position: absolute; top: 10px; right: 10px; font-size: 20px; color: red; }}
            </style>
            <script>
                var countdownDate = new Date('{expirationTime}').getTime();
                var x = setInterval(function() {{
                    var now = new Date().getTime();
                    var distance = countdownDate - now;
                    var hours = Math.floor((distance % (1000 * 60 * 60 * 24)) / (1000 * 60 * 60));
                    var minutes = Math.floor((distance % (1000 * 60 * 60)) / (1000 * 60));
                    var seconds = Math.floor((distance % (1000 * 60)) / 1000);
                    document.getElementById('timer').innerHTML = hours + 'h ' + minutes + 'm ' + seconds + 's ';
                    if (distance < 0) {{
                        clearInterval(x);
                        document.getElementById('timer').innerHTML = 'EXPIRED';
                    }}
                }}, 1000);
            </script>
        </head>
        <body>
            <h1>Welcome to my generated hyperlink</h1>
            <div id='timer'></div>
            <ol>";
        foreach (var question in questions)
        {
            htmlContent += $"<li>{question}</li>";
        }
        htmlContent += "</ol></body></html>";

        // Save the HTML to a file
        string fileName = $"QuestionPaper_{Guid.NewGuid()}.html";
        File.WriteAllText(fileName, htmlContent);

        // Generate a unique URL (for demonstration, using a local path)
        string uniqueUrl = $"http://yourserver.com/{fileName}";

        // Set expiration time (for example, 1 hour from now)
        DateTime expirationTimeDate = DateTime.Now.Add(validDuration);
        
        // Store expiration logic (this would typically involve a database)
        StoreLinkExpiration(uniqueUrl, expirationTimeDate);

        return uniqueUrl;
    }

    private void StoreLinkExpiration(string url, DateTime expirationTime)
    {
        // Logic to store the URL and its expiration time in a database or cache
        Console.WriteLine($"Stored URL: {url} with expiration time: {expirationTime}");
    }
}

// Example usage
var generator = new QuestionPaperGenerator();
string[] questions = { "What is the capital of France?", "What is 2 + 2?" };
string link = generator.GenerateQuestionPaper(questions, TimeSpan.FromHours(1));
Console.WriteLine("Access your question paper at: " + link);
```

### Explanation of Changes

1. **Countdown Timer**: A JavaScript countdown timer is added to the HTML content. It calculates the remaining time until the expiration date and updates every second.
2. **Styling**: Basic CSS is included to position the timer in the top right corner and style the text.
3. **Welcome Message**: The message "Welcome to my generated hyperlink" is displayed prominently at the top of the page.

### Step 2: Testing the Code

1. **Compile and Run**: Compile the C# code in a suitable environment (like Visual Studio) and run it. It will generate an HTML file containing the question paper and the countdown timer.
2. **Access the Link**: Use the printed link to access the generated question paper in your web browser. You should see the countdown timer in the top right corner.

### Conclusion

This implementation provides a user-friendly interface for accessing the question paper while also keeping track of the expiration time dynamically. Feel free to customize the styles and functionality further as needed!

Certainly! To implement the C# code snippet provided, you will need to create a console application that generates an HTML file containing a question paper along with a countdown timer. Below is a step-by-step guide on how to set up the project, create the necessary files, and execute the code.
Step-by-Step Process
Step 1: Create a New C# Console Application
Open Visual Studio:
If you don't have Visual Studio installed, download and install it from the official website.
Create a New Project:
Click on "Create a new project."
Choose "Console App (.NET Core)" or "Console App (.NET Framework)" depending on your preference.
Click "Next."
Configure Your Project:
Name your project (e.g., QuestionPaperGenerator).
Choose a location on your computer.
Click "Create."
Step 2: Add the C# Code
Open Program.cs:
In the Solution Explorer, locate and open the Program.cs file.
Replace the Existing Code:
Delete any existing code in Program.cs and replace it with the provided C# code snippet.
Step 3: Modify Project Settings (if needed)
Ensure that your project is set to use the appropriate .NET version that supports the features used in the code. This is typically set automatically when you create the project.
Step 4: Run the Project
Build the Project:
Click on "Build" in the top menu and then select "Build Solution" (or press Ctrl + Shift + B).
Run the Project:
Click on "Debug" in the top menu and then select "Start Without Debugging" (or press Ctrl + F5).
The console will execute, and you should see the output link printed in the console.
Step 5: Access the Generated HTML File
Locate the Generated HTML File:
The HTML file will be saved in the project directory where your executable is located (usually in the bin\Debug\netcoreappX.X folder, where X.X corresponds to your .NET version).
The file will be named something like QuestionPaper_{GUID}.html.
Open the HTML File:
Navigate to the folder and double-click the generated HTML file to open it in your web browser.
Step 6: Test the Countdown Timer
Once the HTML file is open in your browser, you should see the countdown timer at the top right corner, along with the welcome message and the listed questions.
Step 7: Customize (Optional)
Feel free to modify the questions in the questions array or adjust the styling in the HTML output to better suit your needs.
Conclusion
By following these steps, you will have successfully created a C# console application that generates an HTML page with a countdown timer for a question paper. This project can be further enhanced with additional features, such as storing the link and expiration in a database or implementing more complex question formats. Enjoy coding!
